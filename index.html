          <p>About Me</p>
            <img src="assets/images/Untitled.png" height="350" width="450" > 
            <p1> I am (dont ask thats rude) old.  I have lived in Georgetown, Colorado my entier life. I am currently in the never ending process of home repairs (YA home ownership).  
                I hope to retire or move to Tiipei, Taiwan.  I have two dogs a mastiff named Deva and a cocker spaniel named Moco they are both spolied rotten, and beyond needy.  
                Just to put it out there I am an introvert, which explains my hobbies.  In my free time I read, it is not uncommon for me to have multiple books from multiple
                series that I am currently reading going at once.  I perfer to read Japanes light novels and manga but I also like syfi. My current obsession with books has my 
                library at close to 10,000 books that includes both paper back, digital, and audio.  When I am not reading I am watching anime, playing video games, cosplaying, 
                and any random art projects.  My current art projects is working on several pieces of embroidery for a quilt I am making. I can't tell you much if anything about 
                curent popular TV show,  but if you are interested in politics I am the person to go to. MSNBC, BBC News, and C-SPAN is what I binge.  I enjoy taking walks, but I'm
                allergic to the sun so it's a bit of a pain.  When I have money that I am not saving to go on trip's abroad I love to go see comedins live, the opera, plays 
                (can't wait till I can get my paws on Hamilton tickets).  Tho I live in Colorado i absolutely hate snow. </p1>
